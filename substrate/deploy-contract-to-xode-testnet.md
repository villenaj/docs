## 📑 Upload and Deploy the Contract

1. Navigate to **Developer > Contracts**.
2. Click **Upload & deploy code**.
3. Choose the funded account for deployment.
4. Upload your compiled contract file. You can locate it in your Windows File Explorer using your installed Ubuntu distribution version dynamically. The path format is:

   ```

   Replace `<your-ubuntu-version>` with your actual WSL distribution name (e.g., `Ubuntu`, `Ubuntu-22.04`  or `Ubuntu-24.04`).
   The file to upload is:

   ```bash
   <contract-name>.contract
